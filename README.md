# Frontend Intern Assignment

I have to make a simple todo list in React.js, where the user can add, delete, and mark complete the todo item.


The app consists of multiple reusable components which are combined to make the final UI.

## Things to focus on:

- Created custom, reusable components for the todo list application, including Button, Checkbox, and TodoRow:
  - __Button.tsx__
    Button will have two variants which are `big` and `small`

  - __Checkbox.tsx__
    Checkbox will have a checkbox input and a label. The label should be passed from props.

  - __TodoRow.tsx__
    This will contain the `Checkbox` and `Button` component. The button should only be visible on hover.

- Developed the final application using React.js and combine the reusable components to achieve the desired UI.
- Ensured that all code is properly structured and well documented.
